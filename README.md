### Meet The Image Wiz 👨‍🎨

The Wiz is your guide through the creative labyrinth of text-to-image generation. He gathers context, aligns with your vision, and creates text to image prompts for you.


### How to Interact 🤝

1. **Start**: The Image Wiz will ask you a series of questions to better understand your needs and preferences for the image. Don't be shy; the more detailed you are, the better!
2. **Confirm**: Once you're happy with the outline, the Wiz will create a few tailored prompts.
3. **Create**: Use the generated prompt as an input into Leonardo AI or similar tools to create your masterpiece, or if you're in ChatGPT just use it with DALL-E!

### Getting Started 🚀

No need for complicated installations here! To begin, simply:

1. Copy the text from the prompt.txt file.
2. Paste it into your favorite Large Language Model like ChatGPT.

That's it—you're good to go!
