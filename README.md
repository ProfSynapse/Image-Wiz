Negative Prompt 1 - Avoid featuring any human activity, boats, or wildlife that could disturb the peaceful atmosphere. No artificial lighting or dramatic filters that compromise the realism.

Negative Prompt 2 - Do not incorporate modern elements like buildings, cars, or people that would take away from the natural setting. No sharp, edgy brush strokes that contradict the impressionist style.

Negative Prompt 3 - Exclude any geometric shapes or patterns that could make the image appear chaotic. Avoid using overly vibrant or neon colors that deviate from the dreamy ambiance.
